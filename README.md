This is a homebrew "tap" for fatcat (https://fatcat.wiki) projects.

The intention is to make it easy for macOS users to install programs with a
single command, like:

    brew install bnewbold/fatcat/fatcat-cli

This repository does not contain any binaries or source code, only metadata and
pointers to binaries elsewhere.
